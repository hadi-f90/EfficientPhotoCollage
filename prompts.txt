Prompts given to Grok.

I want you be my python coder.
Using flet library, write a python app that inputs several photo files and put them along each other in A4  or smaller paper series. I want to do this to print  as many quality photos as possible for my album in an A4 paper. I don't mind the size of output as long as it keeps the ratio of A paper series as output. If you need more my explanations do ask me.


======================================
I want it keep efficiency kinda like similar apps used to cut woods, glasses using cnc milling machines. I don't mind the orientation of photo changed, BUT RATHER DO AVOID CROPING IMAGES. since the paper is going to be cut by border of photos.


==================
The app you created in fine. but I think  I found a library https://github.com/secnot/rectpack for rectangle packing. Can you write another version that uses this library.


====================

Can you change the program so that it would not resize the original photos before putting in final canvas. the only important things is that it keeps the proportion of final canvas in A paper series ones. no matter how big the final canvas would get.
